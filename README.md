This project focuses on implementing a network slicing approach within ComNetsEmu, allowing for the dynamic activation and deactivation of network slices.

The PDF file of the project presentation is available in the repository.

## Goal

The primary objective of this project is to facilitate the dynamic management of network slices within a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environment. This entails enabling users to activate and deactivate different slices on-demand, providing flexibility and adaptability to changing network requirements.

## Implementation Overview

- **SDN Controller**: The project utilizes a single RYU SDN controller to manage the network slicing functionality.
- **Network Topology**: The network comprises 8 hosts and 4 switches.

Initially, there is no connection between any hosts. Below is the image with the `pingall` command ran, showing that there is no connection between hosts.

The network is divided into three distinct slices:

  ### 1. Production Slice
  Includes hosts h1, h2, h3, h4, and h8. These hosts are part of the production environment and have bandwidth allocation of 500Mbps.

  ### 2. Management Slice
  Consists of hosts h5 and h7. This slice is dedicated to management tasks and employs different routing paths and bandwidth allocation for UDP and TCP traffic. 300Mbps for TCP traffic and 400Mbps for UDP traffic.

  ### 3. Development Slice
  Comprises hosts h1 and h6, designated for development purposes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the ComNetsEmu VM. For detailed instructions, refer to [ComNetsEmu Setup Instructions](https://www.granelli-lab.org/researches/relevant-projects/comnetsemu-labs). 
2. Clone this repository to your ComNetsEmu virtual machine
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository directory
4. Ensure that Flask is installed. You can install Flask using pip install if it is not already installed:

    ```
    pip install flask
    ```

5. Run the Ryu manager along with the interface:

    ```
    ryu-manager slicing.py
    ```
  You can access the interface using the URL displayed at the end of the output, as highlighted in the image below:

<div align=center><img src="./images/url_shown.png" alt="url_shown" style="width:600px;"/></div>
  
6. Open another terminal window and navigate to the same directory
7. Start Mininet with the provided network configuration:

    ```
    sudo python3 network.py
    ```
    This command will set up the network according to the specified topology and slices.

8. You can now use the interface to activate or deactivate network slices as needed.
9. Additionally, you can perform tests using the Mininet terminal to verify the behavior of the network under different conditions.

## How To Test

### Checking Connectivity

To check the connectivity between all hosts, you can use the `pingall` command in Mininet terminal:

```
pingall
```

Alternatively, to check the connectivity between two specific hosts (e.g., host 1 and host 2), use the following command in Mininet terminal:

```
h1 ping -c3 h2
```
* -c specifies the number of packets to be sent.


### Cleaning Up Mininet

After stopping the network or whenever you encounter an issue in Mininet, use the following command to clean up the Mininet environment (configurations, any running network, hosts, links, etc.):

```
sudo mn -c
```

### Testing TCP Bandwidth

To test the TCP bandwidth between host 1 and host 2, you can use the iperf command in Mininet terminal:

```
iperf h1 h2
```

### Testing UDP Bandwidth

To test the UDP bandwidth, follow these steps:

1. Use the dump command in Mininet to get the PID of the hosts.

2. Choose two hosts for the UDP bandwidth test. Connect to the terminal of each host using the following command in different new terminals:
   
```
sudo mnexec -a <PID> bash
```
3. On one of the hosts, run the following command to start the iperf server in UDP mode:
   
```
iperf -s -u -p 5555 -i 1 > result_udp.txt
```
* -u specifies the UDP test instead of TCP.
* -s runs iperf in server mode, which will wait for a client to connect and start the test.
* -p 5555 sets the port to listen on, which is 5555 in this case.
* -i 1 reports statistics every 1 second.
* \> result_udp.txt redirects the output to a file  

4. On the terminal of the other host, run the following command to start the iperf client and connect to the server:
   
```
    iperf -c <ip_address_of_the_server_host> -u -b 800Mb -p 5555 -t 10
```   
* -c specifies the client mode and sets the IP address of the iperf server to connect to (Recall that in this project, the IP address of each host is in the format 10.0.0.x, where x is a number from 1 to 8, representing the host IDs.).
* -u specifies the UDP protocol.
* -b 800Mb sets the bandwidth for the test, which can be more than the expected result to ensure accuracy.
* -p 5555 specifies the port number to connect on the server, which should be the same as the server's port.
* -t 10 specifies the duration of the test in seconds; you can adjust this according to your needs.

### Viewing Flows in Switches

To see the flows added to the switches, use the following command on a separate terminal:

```
sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows <name_of_the_switch>
```
